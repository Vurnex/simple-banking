# Simple Banking App

Project with the purpose of creating a banking app. It was created using Xamarin Forms on Visual Studio 2019. 

## How It Works

Upon starting the app, the user is presented with a log in page. They can enter an email and password in order to access their bank account. After a successful login, the user is presented with the main page of the app. This page contains tabbed pages that allows the user to...

- View their accounts
- Transfer money between accounts
- Pay bills
- Make a deposit into one of the accounts

Most of the frontend is developed in XAML while the backend is developed in C#. The transaction data is stored and retrieved from an AWS Database.

## What I Learned While Working On This Project

- Developing the frontend of an app using XAML
- Creating and deploying an AWS Database
- Connecting my app to an AWS Database
- App development using Xamarin Forms
- Using View Models to update views in the app
- Data Binding

*Most of the project files have been omitted to reduce the size and time to upload. Only the code demonstrating the implementation is left.
